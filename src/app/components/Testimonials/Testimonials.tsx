        As a member of the inaugural graduating cohort of Manipal School, the wonderful memories and invaluable lessons I learned, both intellectually
        and personally, have intricately woven the very fabric of who I am today. The relentless dedication and unwavering commitment of the school
        and its educators to unearth the latent potential within each of us have propelled us towards living the extraordinary lives we once only
        dared to dream. I remain eternally indebted and profoundly thankful.
